Would you like to upgrade now? You may choose not to upgrade to ${osName} now, but after ${Timer} deferrals your mac will be automatically upgraded.

During this upgrade, you will not have access to your computer! The upgrade can take up to 1 hour to complete.

If using a laptop please make sure you are connected to power.

You must ensure all work is saved before clicking the 'Upgrade Now' button. All of your files and Applications will remain exactly as you leave them.

You can also trigger the upgrade via the Self Service Application at any time e.g. over lunch or just before you leave for the day.

                                                                                                                                    "
